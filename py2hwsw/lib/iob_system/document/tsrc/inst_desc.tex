IOb-System by default contains a RS232 interface that should be connected to an external UART (e.g. a USB-to-serial converter).

The AXI bus for the external memory is optional according to the IOb Parameter configuration of the system. If the system has this port, then it must be connected.

The clock, clock enable, and reset ports can be connected to the desired clock and reset generator.

The IOb-System may also contain memory ports for the boot ROM and RAM, but these memories are instantiated automatically in the IOb-System Memory Wrapper.
