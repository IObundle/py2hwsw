Py2HWSW does this by:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Two-Step Development Process}: The core development is divided
into two distinct phases: the \textbf{setup} phase and the \textbf{build}
phase. During the setup phase, Verilog source files are generated based on
high-level descriptions provided in Python or JSON format. The build phase then
utilizes these Verilog sources to produce the necessary FPGA bitstreams,
netlists, and other deployment files.

\item \textbf{Independent Setup Folders}: Each core is organized within its own
independent setup folder, containing high-level description files and, if
needed, low-level files as well.

\item \textbf{Core Description Input}: The core's specifications are provided
to Py2hwsw in the form of JSON or a Python dictionary, utilizing standard
Py2hwsw attributes.

\item \textbf{Flexible Attribute Handling}: When generating the cores
dictionary via a Python script, users can include a set of standard Py2hwsw
attributes alongside their own custom-defined attributes.
\end{itemize}
