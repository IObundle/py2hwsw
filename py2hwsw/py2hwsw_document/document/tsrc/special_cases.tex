Most of the cores provived by the py2hwsw's library are built using the standard interfaces mentioned in section~\ref{sec:py2_standard_interfaces}.

However, there are some cores that due to limitations of the standard interfaces, rely instead on internal py2hwsw methods for extra features.
The following list describes the cores don't rely solely on the standard interfaces.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{iob\_system}: This core uses the `is\_system` attribute to enable an internal py2hwsw method that automatically fixes the address widths of the cbus interfaces of the system's peripherals.
\item \textbf{iob\_csrs}: The py2hwsw tool contains an internal method to automatically search for the "iob\_csrs" subblock and insert a "\textless prefix\textgreater \_cbus\_s" port on the issuer core of this subblock. It then connects this newly created "\textless prefix\textgreater \_cbus\_s" port of the issuer core to the iob\_csrs "control\_if\_s" port. The '\textless prefix\textgreater ' is replaced by instance name of iob\_csrs subblock.
\end{itemize}
