The py2hwsw framework provides the following two standard interfaces:
1) Core "setup" function receives information from py2hwsw via "Python Parameters".
2) Core "setup" function returns a core description to py2hwsw via a python dictionary.

The core's "setup" function is the python function defined by the user in the <core_name>.py file.

If the core is described by a JSON file, then the "Python Parameters" interface is not available.
The JSON file gives a dictionary to py2hwsw, similar to the python dictionary of the "setup" function.
This allows the user to use external tools to generate cores in JSON format.
