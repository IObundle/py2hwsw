    Decorator for creating class API interface. Apply this decorator to every class in the API.

    This decorator:
    1) Passes attributes defined in the API class to the internal class (via arguments to the internal classes's constructor)
    2) Creates setters/getters for every attribute of API class, but actually accessing internal classes's attributes.
    3) Replaces (abstract) API methods with functions that call the corresponding internal class methods.
    4) Removes attributes from API class. This prevents user from trying to access attributes directly.

    From point of view of the user (even when checking api.py code), he only sees API class with the (getters/setters of the) attributes and methods defined in it.
    The user may instantiate any API class and use its attributes/methods. This decorator will handle the instantiation of the internal class and hide it from user.

    With this decorator, when the user instantiates API class, two objects are created: the API object and the internal object.
    The API object is returned to user. The internal object is stored internally by py2.
    The API and internal objects have a unique id and are associated with each other in a mapping stored internally by py2.

    When py2 needs to pass objects to the user, py2 should only pass API objects (converting from internal objects if needed).
    When the user needs to pass objects to py2, he passes API objects, which py2 will convert to internal objects.
