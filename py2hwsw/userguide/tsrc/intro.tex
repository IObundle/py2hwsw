Open-source Python framework for managing files, automating
project flows of embedded hardware/software codesign projects, and partially generating Verilog
hardware components. The framework simplifies the project structure, addresses challenges in
Hardware Design Languages like Verilog and VHDL, and automates emulation, simulation,
FPGA, and ASIC flows. The proposed Verilog generator offers flexibility, user control, and ease
of use, producing human-readable code compatible across FPGAs and ASICs.
