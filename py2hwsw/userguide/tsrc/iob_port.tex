The \href{https://github.com/IObundle/py2hwsw/blob/main/py2hwsw/scripts/iob_port.py}{iob\_port} class is used to represent an interface for the core.
An interface is a group of hardware ports (wires) that may be generic or follow a standard.
Due to the similarities between a port and a bus, this class inherits the attributes from the `iob\_bus` class (Section~\ref{sec:iob_bus}).
Besides the inherited attributes, the class contains a set of new port specific attributes, each preceded by a comment describing the purpose of the attribute.

Similar to the `iob\_bus` class, the `wires` attribute stores a list of wire objects, represented by the `iob\_wire` class  (Section~\ref{sec:iob_wire}).

% Generator methods
%

The py2hwsw tool uses the `generate\_ports` method from the `io\_gen.py` script to generate the Verilog code for the port based on the attributes from the corresponding instance of the `iob\_port` class.
