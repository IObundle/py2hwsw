Py2HWSW works by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Standard Py2HWSW syntax}: Use a standard Py2HWSW
      syntax to describe each core.
    \item \textbf{Support Python dictionaries and JSON files}: Supports Python
      dictionaries to generate dynamic cores based on IOb parameters. And
      supports JSON files to describe fixed cores and for compatibily with cores
      generated by external tools.
    \item \textbf{Support custom verilog snippets}: Each core may include custom
      verilog snippets for any edge-case which cannot be described using Py2HWSW
      syntax.
    \item \textbf{Internal Object-Oriented structure}: Py2HWSW converts core
      descriptions into its internal object-oriented system, creating high-level
      abstractions of Verilog building blocks.
\end{itemize}
